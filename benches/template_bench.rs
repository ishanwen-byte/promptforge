Quantum computers, on the other hand, use quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously thanks to superposition... This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations at once, leading to potentially exponential speed-ups for certain problems. For example, in cryptography, quantum computers could factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers, threatening current encryption methods. Another example is optimization problems, where quantum computers could explore many possible solutions simultaneously, drastically reducing the time to find the optimal solution.");
